    <h1>DS4200 Final Project: MBTA Rail ridership</h1>
    <h2>By Melina Yang, Renee Reddy, Rhea Johnson, and Iba Baig</h2>
     <p>Boston has been the birthplace of the public transit system in America, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is used 
        by thousands of locals, students, and tourists every day. Our aim is to analyze the MBTA train system to provide more insight to the 
        riders on the functioning of a beneficial, yet sometimes unreliable, system. As students, we often rely on the MBTA to take us to 
        designated locations on time while being on schedule.</p>
      <p>The dataset is sourced from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. It details data regarding ridership for the light and heavy rails.
        It also contains the average ridership for each of multiple attributes, such as season(Fall 2019), route/rail(Green), direction,
        day type(Weekday), stop, and time period. It contains data for the seasons of Fall 2017, Fall 2018, and Fall 2019. It contains about 7, 920 records.
        It examines the total ons and offs, the number of people boarding and unboarding for specific service days within the fields as well. There are some
        notable issues that may have affected the data, such as track circuit issues,track servicing, and construction, which specifically affected the 
        Red Line at Wollastons and the Orange Line at Forest Hills. This is the dataset sourced from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority:

    <h2>Network Graph: Connecting the MBTA lines</h2>
        <img src="images/network_graph.png" alt="Network graph of MBTA routes" />
      <p> This is a network graph of the different routes of the MBTA. It shows all of the stops in the orange line, blue line, green line,
        and red line, colored by each respectively. Stops that are gray mean that more than one line connects to it, which demonstrates connections
      or transfers a rider can take. By integrating a network graph organized by the kamada_kawai layout, it organizes the different lines and their stops.</p>

    <h2>D3 Bar Plot: Ridership Trends of Different Routes</h2>
      <svg id="plot"></svg>
      <script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js'></script>
      <p> This is a D3 bar graph of the average flow of people across each of the main MBTA lines â€“ Green, Red, Blue, and Orange. 
        Each bar represents a specific line, with the height of the bar corresponding to the average flow of passengers. This shows the popularity of each of the lines, with 
        green line being the most popular and orange line being the least. Through this graph, it becomes evident that the Green Line stands out as the most frequented T line, 
        showcasing its significant role in Boston's transit network. This gives a better understanding of which line will generally be busier.</p>

    <h2>Heatmap: Time Periods and Riderships Frequency</h2>
        <img id=heatmap src="images/heatmap_ons.png" alt="Total Passenger Ons throughout the day"/>
        <p>Click on the image to change the graph: The heatmap visualizations illustrate passenger ons and offs across different time periods and routes, scaled to 10 million. 
          Particularly, the Red Line during the PM Peak emerges as the busiest route, evidenced by the highest ons and offs. The heatmaps 
          reveal that early mornings and nights tend to exhibit the least activity, evident from their dark purple (almost black) hue, 
          whereas the AM peak and PM peak appear as the palest yellow, indicating peak activity. This pattern aligns with typical commuting 
          hours, where people primarily utilize trains for work during these peak periods.</p>
        <p>The gradient from dark purple to yellow signifies a progressive increase in total ons and offs, providing a clear depiction of 
          traffic patterns. Overall, these visualizations offer valuable insights into public transportation usage, enabling the identification
          of peak demand periods and popular routes.<p>

    <h2>Bubble Chart: Average Rider Flow of Routes</h2>

        <iframe src="images/bubble_html.html" width="1000" height="650" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      <p>An interactive bubble chart that demonstrates the average flow of people at different stops across the four lines. 
        Each bubble corresponds to a specific station, its size reflecting the average flow volume. To enhance clarity and comparison,
        there is a color coded system, categorizing bubbles based on their respective route lines. 
        Hovering over a bubble triggers an Altair tooltip, revealing details such as stop names, average flow rates,
        and the associated route line, offering users deeper insights. A dropdown menu is also integrated, letting
        users selectively display bubbles related to a chosen route line, which helps facilitate focused analysis.
        Through this visualization, users can explore and understand the average flow patterns across MBTA stations.

    <h2>Interactive Bar Chart: </h2>
      <div id="interactive_chart"></div>
        <iframe src="images/interactive_chart.html" width="1100" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      <p>An interactive bar chart that shows the total ons/offs across time periods of the day for different lines. It shows a stacked bar graph,
        with each color represeting a different line. It also has shows an option to use an Altair selection tool, to select a specific line.
        Once a lin is selected, such as Blue, Green, Orange, or Red, the user will only see a bar graph depciting the total ons and offs for that line.
        The graph also utilizes Altair tooltip to allow a user to hover over the bars, to see the precise values. Through this visualization, 
        a user can gain an undestanding off during which time periods, for which train lines, is the train most used.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> 
          Based on the analysis of MBTA data, several significant conclusions emerge. Firstly, the Red Line stands out with the highest number 
          of ons and offs across various time periods, indicating its popularity and heavy usage among commuters. Moreover, it's evident that 
          the peak time for all MBTA routes consistently occurs during the "pm_peak" period, typically around 5 PM, underscoring the importance of 
          this timeframe for transit planning and service optimization. Additionally, several key stations, including Downtown Crossing, Park Street, 
          South Station, Boylston, and Kendall/MIT, demonstrate the largest average flow of passengers, highlighting their critical role as transit 
          hubs within the system. Furthermore, stations such as Hayward, North Station, Park St, Gov Center, Downtown Crossing, and State St are noteworthy 
          for their connectivity to multiple lines, facilitating seamless transfers for commuters. These findings are particularly significant given 
          the reliance of nearly all Northeastern and other college students in Boston on the train system, emphasizing the importance of efficient 
          and reliable public transit for the city's population.

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
          In our project, we're excited to explore various avenues for enhancing our understanding and optimization of the MBTA 
          transit system. With a focus on the Red and Orange lines, where data gaps exist due to service and construction issues, we plan to 
          gather more comprehensive data sets to accurately depict transit patterns. By integrating geospatial data, we aim to visually represent 
          the actual route lines, providing users with a contextual understanding of each line's trajectory within the broader cityscape. Expanding 
          our network graph to illustrate interconnections between stations will offer users a holistic view of the transit network, facilitating seamless 
          navigation. Additionally, leveraging peak hour and average on/off data, we seek to develop more efficient schedules tailored to passenger demand, 
          optimizing service frequency and reliability. Furthermore, by analyzing average flow data, we intend to identify areas of overcrowding and propose 
          strategic interventions such as additional trains, stops, or routes to alleviate congestion and enhance the commuter experience. Through our collaborative 
          efforts, we aspire to contribute to the continual improvement and efficiency of Boston's transit system, benefiting all commuters who rely on it daily.
