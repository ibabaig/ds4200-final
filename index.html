     <p>  Boston has been the birthplace of the public transit system in America, and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is used 
        by thousands of locals, students, and tourists every day. Our aim is to analyze the MBTA train system to provide more insight to the 
        riders on the functioning of a beneficial, yet sometimes unreliable, system. As students, we often rely on the MBTA to take us to 
        designated locations on time while being on schedule. We are using a dataset of rail ridership provided by the MBTA to understand the
        behavior and needs of the riders, as well as the functioning of the trains themselves.The dataset is sourced from the Massachusetts Bay 
        Transportation Authority:

        It contains data for the seasons of Fall 2017, Fall 2018, and Fall 2019. It contains about 7, 920 records.</p>
